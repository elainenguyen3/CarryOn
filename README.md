Smart Luggage: a device that acts as a travel assistant integrated into travel bags. Currently, its functionality consists of being able to locate itself and telling you about tourist attractions, nearby restaurants, weather, and time to aid you in your travels.
Uses both software (Google Maps API, Node.js, Android Studio, Web Sockets, Heroku) and hardware (speaker, raspberry pi).
